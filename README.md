Issue: Overcrowding at Westmead Hospital

An Android app made for my Info System Project, where you can submit your medical problems through the app and have it display on a
dashboard which we created. The dashboard was not uploaded here since I didn't have any involvement in its creation.
The idea is that you enter your medical issues alongside any photos with your relevant information (name, age, medicare, etc). This information
is then sent to a dashboard which nurses can read for future preparation.

This solves the overcrowding issue as they will be able to make adequate preparations for your arrival and will not be overwhelmed with any
sudden intake of patients. They will have approximately 15-60 minutes to prepare for the patients arrival which should be sufficient time
to arrange any necessary equipment for emergency situations. This was not taken to the real world as the client didn't wish to continue 
development on it as integrating it to their current system would be difficult. He appreciated the idea and hopes to use it in the future.
